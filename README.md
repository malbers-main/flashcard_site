Flashcard Website

Story:
This is my first 'from scratch' website which marks the beginning of a long journey of learning and progressing through coding.

Site Explained:
The site uses arrays to store and access 'stacks' and 'flashcards' that the user creates. The 'stacks' are categories which the
user can add flashcards to, and the 'flashcards' are simply objects which store question and answer information. The site was built 
without a ton of pre-planning so scalability, upgradeability, and time-complexity were not necessarily taken into consideration. My 
goals with the project were to introduce myself to basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, familiarizing myself with each of the languages and 
including some functions which require the creation and storage of objects. 

Bugs/Future Plans:
- There currently is no character limit for stack names, flashcard questions or flashcard answers
- Flashcard information is stored locally to the user's browser, have not checked for data leaks
- On the 'review' page there is no visual indicator when the next flashcard is brought up
- CSS and HTML naming conventions are disorganized and could be scaled better so that less ID's and more classes are used
